      <title>Vuex Sync Part 1</title>

      <description>This is the tale of how I wrote a state syncing framework based on vuex and rollback netcode. It took a few years and isn&amp;rsquo;t intended to be a &amp;ldquo;copy and paste&amp;rdquo; type of thing. I&amp;rsquo;ll be including code fragments and I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually post a cleaned up repo with only the relevant pieces. Who knows, if there&amp;rsquo;s enough interest, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll even post a NPM package.
TL;DR This is a long article.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to start posting project logs here. The focus here will be:
 Programming/Web dev Woodworking Game development Occasionally embedded/firmware type stuff Maybe even baking?  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say exactly what will be here. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting links to any articles I write for Hackaday and Medium.</description>

      <description>Passwordless User Authorization I hate passwords. Not as a user as password management is basically solved with most modern browsers and password managers. What I hate is having to deal with them as a developer. Hashing, storing, authentication, etc.
I did a small project recently using my socket.io synced vuex state and needed a system where users could easily login. I will put a huge disclaimer on this that this is just what I did for my personal project where security isn&amp;rsquo;t critical.</description>
