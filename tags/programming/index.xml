      <description>While I won&amp;rsquo;t go so far as to diagnose myself with ADD without consulting a doctor, those who know me know I can be distracted quite easily. So recently, I decided to do something a little different with a personal project I started a few weeks ago (link to come).
I wrote unit tests.
That may seem rather uninspired, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always poo-pood the idea of test-driven development (TDD), as it seems wild to me to write a test for something that you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it needs to do yet.</description>
