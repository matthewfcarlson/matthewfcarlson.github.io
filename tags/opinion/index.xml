      <description>I love a todo list. It captures my goals and desires in a semi-succinct and concrete way. There are hundreds if not thousands of todo apps and methods. But to me personally, one stands out above all the others.
A simple 3x5 notecard.
This is a how-to or a help article. This is a love letter.
A love letter to paper.
The simple idea of writing down your list of things to do on a physical surface with your own hand is something I love.</description>

      <description>You might have heard the future of cars are electric. Here&amp;rsquo;s a shortlist from mashable that includes all the car manufacturers going electric only.
Bentley - 2030 Jaguar - 2030 GM - 2035 Volvo - 2030 Ford - 2026 (EU only) Volkswagen - 2026 Toyota - 2040 Mercedes - 2035 This list means they are pledging to no longer produce cars that have combustion engines. Many other auto manufacturers are pledging to sell mostly electric vehicles and sell a small number traditional gas cars.</description>

      <description>You might remember the craze that was Great British Bakeoff in its heyday. There was discussion around the water cooler at work about each episode, parodies at SNL, and several spinoff series. While I personally feel that the hype has died down somewhat over the years as it&amp;rsquo;s been going for over 10 years.
While watching the most recent season, I noticed something interesting. There were three finalists and they were all incredible bakers in their own right.</description>

      <title>Roads? Where we’re going, we won’t have any roads.</title>

      <description>Editors Note: Originally posted on medium by me
At least, the way things are going here in the USA. Our roads, as we currently handle them, are unsustainable. As city and states are financially stretched in different and difficult ways, the incredible cost of road maintenance and construction is getting harder and harder for policy makers and government workers to manage. At the rate we are going there will be significantly fewer roads, more traffic, higher taxes, and more pot holes than either you or I could imagine in our worse nightmares.</description>
