      <description>No matter where you go, there&amp;rsquo;s a place in the back of the back alley open at 0am. They sell piping hot covfefe.
Made fresh every doomsday.</description>

      <title>Burger Boy</title>

      <description>I came across this little GIF of someone carving a little burger boy on imgur . As far as I can&amp;rsquo;t, the poster of this GIF isn&amp;rsquo;t the original carver. Doing a quick google doesn&amp;rsquo;t show any burger boys that are similar to this. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;m not stealing some beloved character. It&amp;rsquo;s just a thing I thought was cool.
Reference:
First Attempt The lighting is way too much and I need to add some texture onto the patty.</description>

      <description>This is an early attempt at blender from 2021. It started with a drawing that I loved. I&amp;rsquo;ve poked around Google Images but so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t found the original artist.
I quickly modeled a few things, trying to create a more 3d look rather than sticking with the more stylized look.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this was ultimately the right choice. The moon was a little tricky to get right and I haven&amp;rsquo;t nailed the look of low light.</description>
