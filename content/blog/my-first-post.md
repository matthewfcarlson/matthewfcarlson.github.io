# Welcone to my blog

I'm hoping to start posting project logs here. The focus here will be:

- Programming/Web dev
- Woodworking
- Game development
- Occasionally embedded/firmware type stuff
- Maybe even baking?

It's hard to say exactly what will be here.
Additionally, I'll be posting links to any articles I write for Hackaday and Medium.
