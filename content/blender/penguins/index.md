This is an early attempt at blender from 2021.
It started with a drawing that I loved.
I've poked around Google Images but so far I haven't found the original artist.

I quickly modeled a few things, trying to create a more 3d look rather than sticking with the more stylized look.

I'm not sure if this was ultimately the right choice. 
The moon was a little tricky to get right and I haven't nailed the look of low light.
I want it to look night time without being dark.
So I still have a ways to go here.
I might revisit this.

I might even got for a non perspective projection. Get that flat look that the original artist was going for.

Maybe even some sort of cell shaded look where it can only be a few different colors.
