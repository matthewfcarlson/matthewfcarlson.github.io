I came across this little GIF of someone carving a [little burger boy on imgur](https://imgur.com/t/woodworking/lyRmv5X).

# First Attempt

![attempt 1](burger_boy_v1.png)

The lighting is way too much and I need to add some texture onto the patty.
I also need to make his legs a little shorter.
The automatic weights on the armature didn't turn out quite right.

# Second Attempt
