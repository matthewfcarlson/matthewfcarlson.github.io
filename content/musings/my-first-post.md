# Welcome to my blog

I'm hoping to start posting project logs here. The focus here will be:

- Programming/Web dev
- Woodworking
- Game development
- Occasionally embedded/firmware type stuff
- Blender
- Maybe even baking?

It's hard to say exactly what will be here.
I've brought over the medium articles I've written.
I've included a link to the things I've written on Hackaday, but I don't think I'll bring the actual content over here.
