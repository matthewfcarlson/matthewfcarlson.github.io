I find the 20's to the 50's a very fascinating time in American history.
Perhaps because it is so very different from the life we have today, but still feels relatively closer.
Maybe even more so because the 20's and 30's were so radically different from just 50 years prior.

So in pursuit of learning more about the history of the cinema and to understand more about what life was like by watching what they watched, I'm going to watch the top grossing/most popular movie from each year. 
Most popular is determined by rotten tomatoes and on a few years I'll pick two movies.

Many of the movies in the early years are in the public domain (archive.org and Library Of Congress are good resources). Here's the list.

It's several days of movies. Even just one movie a week is a few years.
I might start writing about watching these movies and sort of review what I think and why they're culturally significant.

If I'm missing any movies, please let me know.
