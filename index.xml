      <description>You might remember the craze that was Great British Bakeoff in its heyday. There was discussion around the water cooler at work about each episode, parodies at SNL, and several spinoff series. While I personally feel that the hype has died down somewhat over the years as it&amp;rsquo;s been going for over 10 years.
While watching the most recent season, I noticed something interesting. There were three finalists and they were all incredible bakers in their own right.</description>

      <title>Simple Passwordless User Authorization</title>

      <description>I hate passwords. Not as a user as password management is basically solved with most modern browsers and password managers. What I hate is having to deal with them as a developer. Hashing, storing, authentication, etc.
I did a small project recently using my socket.io synced vuex state and needed a system where users could easily login. I will put a huge disclaimer on this that this is just what I did for my personal project where security isn&amp;rsquo;t critical.</description>

      <title>Vuex Sync Part 1</title>
      <link>https://matthewc.dev/blog/projects/webdev/vuex-sync-p1/</link>

      <description>This is the tale of how I wrote a state syncing framework based on vuex and rollback netcode. It took a few years and isn&amp;rsquo;t intended to be a &amp;ldquo;copy and paste&amp;rdquo; type of thing. I&amp;rsquo;ll be including code fragments and I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually post a cleaned up repo with only the relevant pieces. Who knows, if there&amp;rsquo;s enough interest, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll even post a NPM package.
TL;DR This is a long article.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to start posting project logs here. The focus here will be:
 Programming/Web dev Woodworking Game development Occasionally embedded/firmware type stuff Maybe even baking?  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say exactly what will be here. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting links to any articles I write for Hackaday and Medium.</description>
