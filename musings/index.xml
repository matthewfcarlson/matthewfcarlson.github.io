      <description>Surveys by Common Sense Media and the Consumer Mobility Report both state a large majority Americans sleep next to their phone or with their phone in hand. According to a 2019 Statista survey , 44% of participants reported feeling some anxiety when separated from their phone (not the same thing as the smartphone itself causing anxiety ).
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a public decrying of how we are hopelessly addicted to our phones.</description>

      <title>I Love Parsec &#43; HomeKit</title>

      <description>I have lots of laptops and one desktop. While jumping around the country, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying to have to setup a dev environment on every machine. There are solutions out there like docker, github codespaces, or renting a VM from one of the dozens of cloud providers.
But I already have a great desktop with everything I want already setup. I work on tons of different projects (most don&amp;rsquo;t see enough work to warrant a writeup) and it&amp;rsquo;s annoying to have to provision the different environment.</description>

      <description>I have a friend who claims food delivery is too expensive and would just go and pick it up themselves. To me, if I&amp;rsquo;m hot and tired from working on some house thing, I love just hitting a button and hopping in the shower knowing some kind soul will deliver food to my door by the time I&amp;rsquo;m out. Ethical concerns about food delivery companies aside (I try to tip well), it&amp;rsquo;s something I value more than my friend does.</description>

      <title>An Ode To Paper Todos</title>
      <link>https://matthewc.dev/musings/paper-todos/</link>

      <description>I love a todo list. It captures my goals and desires in a semi-succinct and concrete way. There are hundreds if not thousands of todo apps and methods. But to me personally, one stands out above all the others.
A simple 3x5 notecard.
This is a how-to or a help article. This is a love letter.
A love letter to paper.
The simple idea of writing down your list of things to do on a physical surface with your own hand is something I love.</description>

      <description>You might have heard the future of cars are electric. Here&amp;rsquo;s a shortlist from mashable that includes all the car manufacturers going electric only.
Bentley - 2030 Jaguar - 2030 GM - 2035 Volvo - 2030 Ford - 2026 (EU only) Volkswagen - 2026 Toyota - 2040 Mercedes - 2035 This list means they are pledging to no longer produce cars that have combustion engines. Many other auto manufacturers are pledging to sell mostly electric vehicles and sell a small number traditional gas cars.</description>

      <title>Great British Effect</title>

      <description>You might remember the craze that was Great British Bakeoff in its heyday. There was discussion around the water cooler at work about each episode, parodies at SNL, and several spinoff series. While I personally feel that the hype has died down somewhat over the years as it&amp;rsquo;s been going for over 10 years.
While watching the most recent season, I noticed something interesting. There were three finalists and they were all incredible bakers in their own right.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to start posting project logs here. The focus here will be:
Programming/Web dev Woodworking Game development Occasionally embedded/firmware type stuff Blender Maybe even baking? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say exactly what will be here. I&amp;rsquo;ve brought over the medium articles I&amp;rsquo;ve written. I&amp;rsquo;ve included a link to the things I&amp;rsquo;ve written on Hackaday, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll bring the actual content over here.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: This was originally published on medium It stands as a unique and marvelous console even by today’s standards. Both from an technical as well as cultural standpoint, it was simply stupendous. This article showcases the history of the Nintendo 64 as well as explores it from a technical standpoint. If you’re like me, you likely have fond memories of this console. If you’re interested in the technical bits, skip ahead to the architecture.</description>

      <title>Roads? Where we’re going, we won’t have any roads.</title>
      <link>https://matthewc.dev/musings/no-roads-for-old-men/</link>

      <description>Editors Note: Originally posted on medium by me
At least, the way things are going here in the USA. Our roads, as we currently handle them, are unsustainable. As city and states are financially stretched in different and difficult ways, the incredible cost of road maintenance and construction is getting harder and harder for policy makers and government workers to manage. At the rate we are going there will be significantly fewer roads, more traffic, higher taxes, and more pot holes than either you or I could imagine in our worse nightmares.</description>
